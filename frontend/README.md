Files for the frontend - that will be later deployed as part of near.social 


Quick layout/files split:

* plaq_template: renders the "main content" of a running challenge (progress, current reward, etc). 
    * challengeState (that contains all the common fields), 
    * challengeLogo (with logo)
    * customBox (content of the top box that is challenge specific)
* dummy_challenge: box for the dummy_challenge
* language_challenge: box for the language challenge
* all_user_challenge: shows all the challenges for a given user (side by side)
* friendslist: shows all the challenges from all your friends.



* welcome_page - main page for the challenges.
